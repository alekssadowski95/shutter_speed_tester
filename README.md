# shutter_speed_tester

The shutter speed tester is a project which goal is to design and build a tool that allows to test the shutter speed accuracy of a film camera



When people passionated with old film cameras want to use their camera to shoot film, this sometimes results in an over or an under exposed film.  
This is usually due to the speed of the camera shutter that is not any more accurate. In order to check the shutter speed accuracy, the camera owner has to compare the actual opening time of the shutter with the expected one.  
This is the purpose of the shutter speed tester : measure the accuracy of shutter speed. 

Here is a presentation video (in French) :

The result of this open source project is to allow anyone who has the minimum skills in DIY domain to build his own device

[Here is the description of the open source project.](project_description.md)

# Baby Shutter Tester
Many people, interested to get such a device but who don't feel skilled enough to build their own copy, asked the author of the project to build it for them.  
This resulted to the commercial version of the tool, the Baby Shutter Tester.  
The Baby Shutter Tester principles are the same as the open source version ones. However, its design has been reworked in order to be smaller and easier to produce in small series.

## Accuracy
The accuracy of the Baby Shutter Tester is checked using [a dedicated benchmark](https://github.com/sebastienroy/shutter_meta_tester).  
The tests show the the tool can be used hand held with a good accuracy at speeds up to 1/250th of a second.  
For speed equal or higher than 1/500, the best precision is achieved using a procedure detailed [in the documentation](baby_shutter_tester/BabyShutterTesterUserManual.md) and [in this video](https://youtu.be/vWWtHFmMRck).
